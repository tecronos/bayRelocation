                Bay Relocation has compiled this comprehensive guide of helpful <a href="movingtips.htm">Moving Tips</a>. Some of these tips may seem 
                obvious, or may not apply to your specific move. Please take some 
                time to review this information, as we are sure you will find that 
                some tips will make your move easier.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Reserving 
                    a Moving Date:</b><br>
                    Book your move ASAP, the further ahead of time the better. We usually 
                    book moves 2-3 weeks in advance. Book further in advance for weekends 
                    or end of month. <a href="contactus.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Contact 
                      Us</font></a> as soon as possible to ensure you get the date you 
                    want.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>When 
                  you book your move, be prepared to provide the <br>
                  following information:<br>
                    </b>Addresses of both old and new residences, cross streets of both 
                  residences, your work, home and cell telephone numbers, and 
                  any intercom/gate codes and apartment numbers, if applicable.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>About 
                  Parking on Moving Day:</b><br>
                  It is your resposibility to provide the crew with a reasonable distance to  carry your furniture 
                  from the premises to the moving truck, and vice versa. Keep in mind 
                  that some streets prohibit double-parking due to congestion or public 
                  transportation, such as cable cars in San Francisco. If your street 
                  does not allow double-parking, or is normally crowded with parked 
                  cars, you may be able to block off parking with your vehicle or 
                  a friend's vehicle (3 car lengths required). If that isn't possible, you will need to call your local Police Department and to obtain  a parking permit. In San Francisco 
                  you can call 415.553.0123.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Street 
                  Cleaning:</b><br>
If possible, avoid booking your move during street cleaning. It is your responsibility to ensure proper parking for the movers. You will be charged for any parking ticket fees our moving truck incurs during the move.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><strong>Is a Certificate 
                  of Liability Insurance required by your building management? </strong><br>
                  If so, it is your responsibility to provide our staff with the necessary information required to generate the Certificate. Failure to do so in a timely manner may impact your move. <a href="contactus.htm">Contact</a> our office for more details about what information you'll need.  It typically takes 5 buisness days to generate the Certificate so please plan accordingly.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Check 
                  Your Building Rules and Regulations Regarding Move-In/ Move-Out:</b><br>
                  Speak with your Landlord or Building manager to find out about any 
                  building rules your movers need to follow on Moving day. Do you need to reserve the elevator with 
                  management? Is there a specific time frame allowed for your "Move-In" 
                  or "Move-Out"? Is masonite required for floor protection? Some managers 
                  will provide a key that works the elevator. This is extremely important 
                  and will expedite your move. Try to obtain such a key if this applies 
                  to your move. </font></p>
                <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033">Re-Evaluate 
                  Your Household Goods:</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><br>
                    Determine in advance whether all of your belongings and furniture 
                    are going to your new residence, or if it's time to downsize. You 
                    can get rid of unwanted household items by having a garage sale, 
                    or by donating to a local charitable institution. For donations, 
                    please check our list of <a href="reminders.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Bay 
                      Area Charities</font></a>. Keep in mind that the less items you 
                    have, the more you save on the moving bill.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Chemicals, 
                  Explosives & Hazardous Waste Materials:</b><br>
                  Moving companies are not allowed to transport  hazardous items. 
                  Therefore, it is your responsibility to dispose of or relocate them. 
                  We will transport empty propane tanks from your barbecue 
                  (as long as they are completely empty). You may also call your local 
                  household hazardous waste facility listed in the phone book under 
                  the government pages. To schedule a free home pick-up, call (800) 
                  449-7587 or for more info about this subject call (415) 554-4333.</font></p>

                  Help on Moving Day:</b><br>
                  Golden Bay Relocation is a friendly company which welcomes your 
                  friends and family to expedite your move and make it more cost effective 
                  The only issue we want to emphasize is that due to liability circumstances, 
                  we do not allow any person other than the crew onto the moving 
                  truck.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Children 
                  and Pets:</b><br>
                  To be able to expedite your move, we recommend that you arrange 
                  for proper childcare. With respect to your pets, they are better 
                  off segregated from the movers. Since it's moving day, the entrance 
                  to your residence will be kept open, thus allowing your four-legged 
                  friends to roam the neighborhood. You may want to temporarily place 
                  your pet in the bathroom. However, if you do so, please place a 
                  sign on the outside of the door stating so. For more information 
                  about moving with children and/or moving with pets check out our <a href="movingtips.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Moving Tips</font></a> section.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Bills:</b><br>
                  Clean up all outstanding accounts. Disconnect or transfer utilities 
                  if necessary. Pay off any debts and collect from those who owe you.To 
                  help you with this transition, look at our <a href="reminders.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Helpful

                  and Maps:</b><br>
                  Although Golden Bay Relocation carries every single map of the Greater 
                  Bay Area, it will not hurt to provide us with written directions 
                  and/or a diagram of your new residence. You can obtain detailed 
                  driving directions by visiting <a href="http://www.mapquest.com" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF">www.mapquest.com</font></a>.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Keep 
                  Yourself Accessible on Moving Day:</b><br>
                  Be sure your mover is able to reach you at all times on moving day, 
                  at either your old or new residence. If your cellular telephone 
                  number was provided to us, please be sure to have your phone turned 
                  on, near you, with sufficient battery supply. We will normally give 
                  our customer a call if we are running late beyond 15 minutes. If 
                  you did not provide us with a cellular telephone number, please 
                  be sure that your home telephone is connected and still operating 
                  on moving day. If your home telephone happens to be disconnected, 
                  and if you happen to live in a building with an intercom system, 
                  be aware that your intercom may not work since this is usually connected 
                  to your telephone line.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Set 
                  Aside the Following:</b><br>
                  Legal, medical and insurance documents, new and old keys, checkbook, 
                  cash, medicine, jewelry, items of small size that are of exceptional 
                  value (either sentimental or monetary). You might also want to have 
                  a set of comfortable clothing for after the move, along with toiletries, 
                  cosmetics, toothbrush and water.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>When 
                  the Movers Arrive:</b><br>
                  Have the door and gate propped open, otherwise your movers will 
                  take care of it. Be sure to have the hallways free and clear of 
                  boxes and debris. This makes it easier for the movers to start. 
                  Be ready to complete and sign the contract. Don't get nervous 
                  and do not sign anything unless it seems clear to you. Ask as many 
                  questions as you wish. Your mover will provide to you free of charge 
                  a booklet called "Important Information For Persons Moving 
                  Household Goods (within California)". This booklet informs 
                  you about your moving rights. We recommend you read this booklet 
                  in case something goes wrong with your move. Keep your contract, 
                  the booklet and our business card with you at all times during the 
                  move. Be prepared to give us a tour of your home to show us everything 
                  that is being moved to the new location (including lawn furniture, 
                  plants, bicycles and stored items in basement/garage or hidden closets), 
                  and what is not. If possible, set aside those items which are not 
                  being moved, or mark them with a sign. It is also very important 
                  that you advise your movers of any delicate piece of furniture, 
                  or items of high sentimental or monetary value, or of special care 
                  required for the premises (new carpet, newly painted walls or refinished 
                  hardwood floors, etc.) Your movers will be able to give some extra 
                  attention to these special items. Keep the vacuum aside and readily 
                  available to clean the wall-to-wall carpet or rugs as we empty out 
                  your residence.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Last 
                  Check:</b><br>
                  Take one last look around. Locate the keys to the new residence. 
                  Turn off the furnace and lights. Close and lock doors. Take a last 
                  minute tour of your place, including closets and closed off areas, 
                  back yard and basement/garage for forgotten items. Arrange for dropping 
                  off/picking up keys with landlord or agent if necessary.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>Forms 
                  of Payment:</b><br>
                  Payment is due in full once your move is completed. We require cash or certified check as payment from first-time customers; repeat customers may pay by cash or check. If you decide to tip 
                  the movers, it will be best if you tip by cash, otherwise you may 
                  add it to the check. We welcome tips for our hardworking crews.</font></p>
