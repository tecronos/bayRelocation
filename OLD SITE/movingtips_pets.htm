                    of all, before you relocate, please do not forget to update the 
                    identification information on your pet&#146;s collar I.D. tag.

                  whenever possible, scout your new neighborhood for the nearest 
                  veterinarian.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000033">It 
                  is important that you realize that your pet may get just as stressed 
                  as you during this transition, if not more. We have found the 
                  following article about moving with your cat to be very helpful.</font></p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>MOVING 
                  WITH YOUR CAT </em>By Don Vaughan</font>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CATS, 
                  AS A RULE, DON&#146;T LIKE TO TRAVEL. A quick jaunt to the veterinarian 
                  can traumatize a sensitive kitty for days; a cross-country trek 
                  can be enough to put both of you in the loony bin.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
                  sometimes moving is unavoidable. A new job, for example, or retirement 
                  from an old one can mean packing everything you own schlepping 
                  to another state with your beloved cat in tow.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyone 
                  who has moved with a cat, whether it&#146;s across town or across 
                  the country, will tell you it&#146;s no easy feat. The key to 
                  success, say the experts, is advance planning and consideration 
                  for your cat&#146;s needs.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;A 
                  LITTLE PLANNING GOES A LONG WAY WHEN YOU PREPARE YOUR CAT FOR 
                  A MOVE AND FOR AN ADJUSTMENT TO A NEW HOME.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Create 
                  a Plan</b><br>
                  &#147;One of the most common mistakes people make when moving 
                  with their pets is not planning ahead,&#148; confirms Suzanne 
                  Hetts, Ph.D., a certified applied Animal Behavior Associates in 
                  Colorado.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;For 
                  example, don&#146;t wait until the last minute to get your cat 
                  used to staying in a carrier or riding in a car. That&#146;s not 
                  going to work.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  degree of trauma a move can inflict on a cat depends on the animal, 
                  Hetts says. Well-socialized cats that have been exposed to environmental 
                  changes as kittens and are generally outgoing will usually handle 
                  a move with little difficulty. In fact, they may find it tremendous 
                  fun, playing in moving boxes and snoozing in empty drawers.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;But 
                  for other cats that weren&#146;t well-socialized or that are inherently 
                  shy and timid, anything new in their environment is going to upset 
                  them,&#148; Hetts says. &#147;There is a lot of individual variability; 
                  it all depends on what kind of animal you have.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don&#146;t 
                  assume your cat won&#146;t know what&#146;s going on when you 
                  start bringing home boxes and filling them with household items. 
                  Cats are astute about their surroundings and quickly sense change. 
                  Some don&#146;t care, but others can become stressed and depressed. 
                  The result: sudden behavior problems, most commonly urination 
                  outside the litter box. &#147;Change in litter box habits is just 
                  one of the many ways cats seem to declare their stress or unhappiness,&#148; 
                  explains Michael Abdella, D.V.M. ,a veterinarian at Viejo Animal 
                  Hospital in California. &#147;It&#146;s usually a temporary problem. 
                  Once the cats adjust to their new surroundings, things should 
                  return to normal.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sometimes 
                  we recommend a course of sedation just to take the edge off, so 
                  they can settle in a little easier. Most cats seem to do pretty 
                  well with that.&#148;<br>
                  But before agreeing to sedate your cat, make sure you discuss 
                  potential side effects and risks. Older cats, for example, don&#146;t 
                  tolerate strong sedatives as well as younger cats. Ask about alternatives.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Getting 
                  a cat used to the move early in the game can make things easier 
                  for both of you.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Start 
                  Early and Slowly</b><br>
                  If you&#146;re driving across-country and your cat rides in the 
                  car only twice a year, getting it acclimated to spending long 
                  periods in a carrier is essential, Hetts says. She suggests taking 
                  it on longer and longer rides before the move and talking to it 
                  soothingly so it sees riding in the car as a pleasant experience. 
                  Do this routine as far ahead of the move as possible.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  same goes for a plane trip. This is often a traumatic experience 
                  for a cat, especially if it must be placed in the cargo bay away 
                  from it&#146;s reassuring owner. Getting the cat used to spending 
                  time in a carrier beforehand can make the journey much more tolerable.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. 
                  Abdella suggest waiting until you move to move your cat. Don&#146;t 
                  send it ahead with the furniture; your absence, even for a little 
                  while, can cause your cat to become increasingly stressed and 
                  anxious.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If 
                  that isn&#146;t an option, you might want to consider boarding 
                  it during the move,&#148; Dr. Abdella says. &#147;That way the 
                  cat doesn&#146;t know what&#146;s going on at home and all the 
                  stress and change won&#146;t affect it as much.&#148;<br>
                  Sometimes, however, you have no choice; you pack the cat and go. 
                  Sunny Parsons, a newspaper editor in Washington, traveled there 
                  by car from Florida with her friend, Kim Dorothea, and their cats, 
                  Sibyl and Agnes. They did everything they could to make the eight 
                  day trip easy on their pets, but problems still arose.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;IT&#146;S 
                  IMPORTANT, TOO, THAT ALL ESCAPE ROUTES ARE ELIMINATED AND ALL 
                  WINDOW SCREENS ARE SECURE.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 
                  most difficult part of the trip was smuggling the cats into motels,&#148; 
                  Sunny recalls. &#147;We tried to arrange reservations at motels 
                  that allowed animals, but sometimes you&#146;ll never know where 
                  you will end up after a day on the road.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                  South Dakota, Sunny and Kim stayed in a motel that had a beautiful 
                  picture window with vertical blinds, which intrigued the cats 
                  to no end. Fearful the management might see their feline contraband, 
                  Sunny first tried to tape the blinds closed, then finally shoved 
                  a suitcase against the window to block it.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
                  in Montana, Kim&#146;s cats, Agnes, took refuge deep inside a 
                  bed and wouldn&#146;t come out. &#147;At first, we thought she 
                  had gotten out of the room and was lost in the wilds of Montana,&#148; 
                  Sunny says with a laugh. &#147;But after looking around outside, 
                  we realized that really wasn&#146;t possible, so we ransacked 
                  our motel room looking for her. We finally found her in the box 
                  spring and had to tear the bed apart to get her. We took off the 
                  mattress and turned the box spring upside down so she&#146;d come 
                  out.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sunny&#146;s 
                  cat, Sibyl, was coping with kidney disease at the time of the 
                  move, so every time she cried, Sunny would pull over and put her 
                  in the litter box they kept in the back seat. &#147;She caught 
                  on after a while,&#148; Sunny says. &#147;Every time she wanted 
                  to get out of her carrier, she knew to meow. But she would never 
                  go to the bathroom.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It&#146;s 
                  essential that your cat be allowed to stretch its legs during 
                  a long move, Dr. Abdella notes. Don&#146;t keep it cooped up in 
                  a carrier 24 hours a day.<br>
                  &#147;During long car trips, a lot of cats need to be sedated,&#148; 
                  he adds. &#147;They&#146;ll talk and cry the whole time and everyone 
                  kind of goes stir crazy in the car. It all depends on your cats 
                  disposition and whether or not they&#146;re going to be stressed 
                  by something like that.&#148;</font></p>

                      girlfriend, Maryann Hutchison, were moving from LA. to the San 
                      Francisco area, and Ginn ended up making the final trip by car

                    I thought everything would be okay,&#148; Ginn says. &#147;I decided 
                    to keep driving and see what he did.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    exploring the back seat, Midnight sneaked between Ginn and the 
                    driver&#146;s door and lay on the dashboard in front of the steering 
                    wheel. &#147;It wasn&#146;t really a problem because I could see,&#148; 
                    Ginn recalls. &#147;Then he moved over to my right side and stepped 
                    off. What I didn&#146;t realize was that in doing so, he turned 
                    off the ignition. The car just stopped. I had just had some transmission 
                    work done on the car, so I was worried there was something really 
                    wrong.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    pulling over to the right lane and expecting the worst, Ginn started 
                    feeling around. It was then that he realized the ignition key 
                    had been turned off. He restarted the car and continued to drive. 
                    &#147;The rest of the trip was relatively uneventful,&#148; Ginn 
                    says. Be sure to provide your cat with a secure carrier for the 
                    move. Cats roaming free in the car may appear more at ease but 
                    can endanger the driver as well as themselves in a crisis situation.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Intorducing 
                    New Surrondings</b><br>
                    Introducing a cat to its new home can be as difficult as the move 
                    itself, say experts. Like the trip, it&#146;s best to approach 
                    things slowly and cautiously.<br>
                    &#147;It&#146;s very much like what you would do if you were bringing 
                    a new cat or kitten into your household for the first time,&#148; 
                    says behaviorist Hetts. &#147;Get them used to one room first 
                    by putting out all their necessities, such as food, water, litter 
                    box and scratching post. This is especially important if movers 
                    are coming in and out. You don&#146;t want your cat to get out 
                    and become lost.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hetts 
                    adds: &#147;Don&#146;t force your cat to explore the new house. 
                    Let it do whatever it wants to do. If it wants to hide out for 
                    a week, then let it. If it wants to get into everything, let it. 
                    It will handle things on its own terms.&#148;<br>
                    It&#146;s important that you watch for signs that your cat is 
                    not adjusting well, such as lack of appetite, continued house-soiling 
                    or hiding out long after an acceptable period, Dr. Abdella says.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If 
                    this happens, have your cat checked by a veterinarian to make 
                    sure it&#146;s in good health. If it is, you&#146;ll just have 
                    to accept the fact that it&#146;s going to take a little longer 
                    adjustment period,&#148; Dr. Abdella says.<br>
                    &#147;Another thing: When you let the cat out of its carrier for 
                    the first time, make sure all doors and windows are closed because 
                    when they run and hide, you don&#146;t know where they are going 
                    to go.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                    Terry Ginn woke up the morning after his late -night move, he 
                    couldn&#146;t find Mischieh and Midnight anywhere. After tearing 
                    the house apart, he finally located them inside a kitchen cupboard, 
                    huddled together. They had apparently learned how to open the 
                    door in the middle of the night, and climbed in for security.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Familiarity 
                    can help a cat quickly adjust to its new surroundings, notes Hetts. 
                    If your pet sleeps on a favorite blanket, bring it along unwashed 
                    so your pet will feel more at home. The same goes for toys and 
                    other favorite items; the less the change the cat experiences, 
                    the easier it&#146;ll cope.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
                    your cat is a indoor/outdoor animal, check your yard and neighborhood 
                    thoroughly for hazardous such as pesticides, wandering dogs and 
                    busy streets before you let it outside. Hetts suggests keeping 
                    it in for several weeks before its first outdoor visit, then watching 
                    closely.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Personally, 
                    I don&#146;t like to see cats outside unsupervised. I just think 
                    it&#146;s too dangerous for them,&#148; Hetts says. &#147;But 
                    if that&#146;s what someone wants to do, I suggest they build 
                    an outside enclosure for their cat and let it get used to the 
                    yard slowly. Follow the cat to make it can&#146;t get into trouble.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Safety-proofing 
                    your new home is equally important, say the experts. Check for 
                    toxic chemicals, frayed extension cords and anything else within 
                    paws reach that could endanger your pet. &#147;You should also 
                    be careful of second floor balconies and windows,&#148; warns 
                    Dr. Abdella. &#147;Make sure the animal is introduced to things 
                    like this slowly so it doesn&#146;t go diving off by accident. 
                    That isn&#146;t common, but I have heard of it happening.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s 
                    important, too, that all escape routes are eliminated and all 
                    window screens are secure,&#148; Dr. Abdella says. &#147;If your 
                    cat gets outside and doesn&#146;t know where its new home is, 
                    that can be a problem.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                    addition, Dr. Abdella suggests closely examining the carpet of 
                    your new home, especially if the previous owners had pets. &#147;If 
                    they did, and you think there may have been urinary problems, 
                    those carpets need to be cleaned very, very well, because otherwise 
                    it could encourage your cat to start house-soiling, too,&#148; 
                    he explains. &#147;If necessary, have the carpet replaced. House-soiling 
                    is a cycle you don&#146;t want to start.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
                    you&#146;re moved in and your cat has become adjusted to it&#146;s 
                    new surroundings, it&#146;s time to find a new veterinarian (unless, 
                    of course, you&#146;ve just moved across town).</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    best time to do this is before you move. Ask your current veterinarian 
                    if he can recommend someone in your new town. If he can&#146;t 
                    help, ask your neighbors or co-workers who they see and if they&#146;re 
                    happy with the service.<br>
                    &#147;Don&#146;t forget to get a copy of your cat&#146;s medical 
                    records from your previous veterinarian before you move,&#148; 
                    Dr. Abdella notes. &#147;If your new veterinarian has to request 
                    them, it can take a long time for them to arrive.&#148; Most veterinarians 
                    will give you the documents for free, though some may charge a 
                    small copying fee.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Armed 
                    with your cat&#146;s current records and a plan to accommodate 
                    your feline friend&#146;s needs, a move across town or across 
                    the country should be easy for you and your cat.<br>
