                      <em>How to Make it Easier For Them</em> by Katharine Canfield</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moving 
                  can be as challenging as it is exciting. Sometimes more so. Moving 
                  is as hard for kids as it is for adults. They, too, are leaving 
                  behind familiar places and important friends. They, too, are starting 
                  over: seeking new friends and adjusting to a new home, neighborhood, 
                  and school. But because they're still learning how to socialize 
                  and how to effectively get their needs met, children need caring 
                  adults to listen and help them adjust to their new home, now more 
                  than ever.<br>
                                <br>
                  If you're a parent contemplating a move, this article's for you. 
                  By considering a move in three stages - before, during, and after 
                  - and thinking about your children's needs during each stage, 
                  you can make a big difference in how your kids feel about the 
                  move and how they adjust afterwards.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Before 
                  the Move: Preparing...</b><br>
                                <br>
                  Tell your children about the move as soon as you can. The more 
                  time they have to think about and prepare for the move, the easier 
                  it will be for them.<br>
                                <br>
                  Give your children a chance to express their feelings, and try 
                  to be honest about your own feelings. Most children will feel 
                  some anger, sadness, or worry about the move. These responses 
                  are natural, and kids who have a chance to express them will work 
                  through their doubts more easily. Gently tell your children about 
                  any sadness you may feel about leaving or uncertainty about a 
                  new home, job, or city. This will reassure them that they aren't 
                  alone in having worries or concerns.<br>
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Help 
                  older children prepare a list of phone numbers and addresses of 
                  close friends, relatives, and other important people in their 
                  lives. Knowing they can stay in touch with these people is an 
                  important part of a successful move.<br>
                                <br>
                  If your kids are old enough, let them participate in decision 
                  making. Have the kids keep a notebook of potential new homes with 
                  the positives and the negatives listed.<br>
                                <br>
                  If you are able to, before you move take your children to your 
                  new home and explore the new neighborhood and town or city together. 
                  If this isn't possible, take pictures of your new home, the schools 
                  your kids will attend, a nearby park, and anything else that would 
                  be interesting to them.<br>
                                <br>
                  Make a scrapbook containing pictures of your pre-move home, friends, 
                  and other mementos of your life together.<br>
                                <br>
                  Call the principal of your children's schools, and try to set 
                  up a meeting with their teachers or, if they're in junior high 
                  or high school, guidance counselor. The new school may even be 
                  able to give you names of students in your child's class who live 
                  near your new home. If so, you may want to drop by to meet them 
                  and their families before you move in.<br>
                                <br>
                  Try to line up some activities in which your child can participate 
                  after the move: a sports team, music lessons, art classes, a scouting 
                  troop. Not only will activities like these keep your children 
                  involved; they'll also help them to feel like part of a group 
                  - an important aspect of settling in. Try to sign up for more 
                  than one activity in case one falls through or doesn't go well.<br>
                                <br>
                  If you can, try to meet families in your new neighborhood before 
                  you move. Being familiar with people when you move in will help 
                  your children feel more at home.</font></p>
                <div align="left">
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>During 
                      the Move: Remembering What's Important...</b></font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout 
                    the move, stay as upbeat and calm as you can; a good plan makes 
                    this possible. Your own mood will impact other family members, 
                    especially babies, who are particularly sensitive to their mother's 
                    feelings. With older children, it's important to be honest about 
                    some of the uncertainties you have, but also to be generally 
                    optimistic about the move and the positive ways it will affect 
                    the family.<br>
                                    <br>
                    Involve your kids in the packing. Older kids can put their own 
                    belongings in boxes, and kids of all ages will enjoy decorating 
                    the boxes containing their things. Doing so will also make finding 
                    your children's things easier once you're at the new house!<br>
                                    <br>
                    Try to stick to your routines. Have meals at the same times 
                    as always. If your kids nap, encourage them to lie down at the 
                    usual time. Keep to the normal bedtimes.<br>
                                    <br>
                    Don't pack things that your children treasure. Take special 
                    blankets, beloved stuffed animals, favorite books, and other 
                    prized items in a separate bag or box that you can bring with 
                    you in the car or on the plane when you go to your new home.<br>
                                    <br>
                    Help your children say good bye to the important people in their 
                    lives. For their friends, a pizza or make-your-own sundae party 
                    is a fun way to celebrate the friendship. An album or poster 
                    with photos of good times together will add to the celebration. 
                    If your children are comfortable, encourage hugs at the end 
                    of the party. With neighbors or other special adults, you may 
                    want to set up a time to stop by and say good bye as a<br>
                    family.<br>
                    <br>
                    Expect the unexpected: few moves go smoothly, anticipate trouble 
                    (predict it!) and have a positive, &quot;can do&quot; attitude.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>After 
                    the Move: Getting Settled...</b></font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't 
                    spend too much time unpacking - at least not right away! Sure, 
                    the essentials are important to unload and you want the house 
                    to feel settled. But wait on the less important stuff. In the 
                    first few days, take time to enjoy your new home with your family. 
                    Take walks. Check out local restaurants and take-out spots. 
                    Introduce yourselves to your new neighbors. Spend time at the 
                    park.<br>
                                    <br>
                    Be on the look-out for neighborhood kids, and help introduce 
                    your children to them. If it's comfortable for you and your 
                    children, invite some of the neighborhood kids over for pizza 
                    or a video.<br>
                                    <br>
                    Let your children have some input in planning on the new house, 
                    especially in choosing things to buy for their rooms. Even if 
                    you don't follow through on their ideas, it's important to listen 
                    to what they think. Be tactful if you choose another option, 
                    and let some decisions be entirely up to them - for example, 
                    the placement of their bed or the color of the rug or paint 
                    in their bedroom.<br>
                                    <br>
                    Get involved: church groups, synagogues, YMCA and activity clubs, 
                    etc. enable socializing. If a couple of months have gone by 
                    and your child seems unusually troubled, ask a doctor, guidance 
                    counselor, or principal if you need a referral. Signs that your 
                    child may need help: unusual academic difficulty; ongoing irritability; 
                    trouble with peers; changes in sleep or eating habits; a generally 
                    despondent mood. Give them time, this behavior can last for 
                    4-5 months for teens.<br>
                                    <br>
                    Above all, listen. Try to be there when your kids get home after 
                    the first day at their new schools, even if it means having 
                    to leave work early that day. Regularly ask how things are going, 
                    and take time to listen. Sometimes kids have a hard time opening 
                    up; spending relaxed time together may help them to bring up 
                    whatever is on their minds.<br>
                                    <br>
                    For children and adults, it takes time to feel at home. With 
                    your understanding and patience, your children will be reassured 
                    that, after a while, things will get easier; everything won't 
                    feel so new; and that home is, after all, wherever the family 
                    is.<br>
