										Golden Bay Relocation LLC has compiled this 

										comprehensive guide of helpful

										<a href="packtips.htm">Moving Tips.</a> 

										Some of these tips may seem obvious, or 

										may not apply to your specific move. 

										Please take some time to review this 

										information, as we are sure you will 

										find that some tips will make your move 

										easier.</font><p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Reserving a Moving Date:</b><br>

										Book your move ASAP, the further ahead 

										of time the better. We usually book 

										moves 2-3 weeks in advance. Book further 

										in advance for weekends or end of month.

										<a href="contact.htm">

										<font color="#0000ff">Contact Us</font></a> 

										as soon as possible to ensure you get 

										the date you want.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>When you book your move, be prepared 

										to provide the following information:<br>

										</b>Addresses of both old and new 

										residences, cross streets of both 

										residences, your work, home and cell 

										telephone numbers, and any intercom/gate 

										codes and apartment numbers, if 

										applicable.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>About Parking in San Francisco:</b><br>

										It is your responsibility to provide the crew with a 
										reasonable distance to carry your furniture from the 
										premises to the moving truck, and vice versa. Keep in 
										mind that some streets in San Francisco prohibit double-parking 
										due to congestion or public transportation, such as cable cars. 
										If your street does not allow double-parking, or is normally 
										crowded with parked cars, you may be able to block off parking 
										with your vehicle or a friend's vehicle (3-4 car lengths required). 
										If that isn't possible, you will need to contact S.F.M.T.A to obtain a 
										parking permit. 415.701.2311 or 415.550.2733 or online: 
										<a href="http://www.sfmta.com/cms/ptemp/indxpktemp.htm">SFMTA</a> (we need 4 posted signs ~ $163)</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Street Cleaning:</b><br>

										It is not a bad idea to schedule your move during a street cleaning schedule. </font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<strong>Is a Certificate of Liability Insurance (C.O.I), 
										required by your H.O.A or building management?  </strong><br>

										If so, it is your responsibility to provide us with the 
										necessary information required to generate the Certificate. 
										Failure to do so in a timely manner may impact your move. 
										Contact our office for more details about what information 
										you'll need. It typically takes 3 business days to generate 
										the Certificate so please plan accordingly.We charge $20 
										for the first C.O.I ($10 for the 2nd certificate).</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Check Your Building Rules and 

										Regulations Regarding Move-In/ Move-Out:</b><br>

										Speak with your Landlord or Building 

										manager to find out about any building 

										rules your movers need to follow on 

										Moving day. Do you need to reserve the 

										elevator with management? Is there a 

										specific time frame allowed for your 

										&quot;Move-In&quot; or &quot;Move-Out&quot;? Is masonite 

										required for floor protection? Some 

										managers will provide a key that works 

										the elevator. This is extremely 

										important and will expedite your move. 

										Try to obtain such a key if this applies 

										to your move. </font></p>

										<p><b>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										Re-Evaluate Your Household Goods:</font></b><font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2"><br>

										Determine in advance whether all of your 

										belongings and furniture are going to 

										your new residence, or if it's time to 

										downsize. You can get rid of unwanted 

										household items by having a garage sale, 

										or by donating to a local charitable 

										institution. For donations, please check 

										our list of <a href="reminders.htm">

										<font color="#0000ff">Bay Area Charities</font></a>. 

										Keep in mind that the less items you 

										have, the more you save on the moving 

										bill.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Chemicals, Explosives &amp; Hazardous 

										Waste Materials:</b><br>

										Moving companies are not allowed to 

										transport hazardous items. Therefore, it 

										is your responsibility to dispose of or 

										relocate them. We will transport empty 

										propane tanks from your barbecue (as 

										long as they are completely empty). You 

										may also call your local household 

										hazardous waste facility listed in the 

										phone book under the government pages. 

										To schedule a free home pick-up, call 

										(800) 449-7587 or for more info about 

										this subject call (415) 554-4333.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Recruit Help on Moving Day:</b><br>

										Golden Bay Relocation is a friendly 

										company which welcomes your friends and 

										family to expedite your move and make it 

										more cost effective The only issue we 

										want to emphasize is that due to 

										liability circumstances, we do not allow 

										any person other than the crew onto the 

										moving truck.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Children and Pets:</b><br>

										To be able to expedite your move, we 

										recommend that you arrange for proper 

										childcare. With respect to your pets, 

										they are better off segregated from the 

										movers. Since it's moving day, the 

										entrance to your residence will be kept 

										open, thus allowing your four-legged 

										friends to roam the neighborhood. You 

										may want to temporarily place your pet 

										in the bathroom. However, if you do so, 

										please place a sign on the outside of 

										the door stating so. For more 

										information about moving with children 

										and/or moving with pets check out our

										<a href="packtips.htm">

										<font color="#0000ff">Moving Tips</font></a> 

										section.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Bills:</b><br>

										Clean up all outstanding accounts. 

										Disconnect or transfer utilities if 

										necessary. Pay off any debts and collect 

										from those who owe you. To help you with 

										this transition, look at our

										<a href="reminders.htm">

										<font color="#0000ff">Helpful Reminders</font></a> 

										section.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Directions and Maps:</b><br>

										Although Golden Bay Relocation carries 

										every single map of the Greater Bay 

										Area, it will not hurt to provide us 

										with written directions and/or a diagram 

										of your new residence. You can obtain 

										detailed driving directions by visiting

										<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mapquest.com">

										<font color="#0000ff">www.mapquest.com</font></a>.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Keep Yourself Accessible on Moving 

										Day:</b><br>

										Be sure your mover is able to reach you 

										at all times on <a href="movingdaytips.htm">
										<font color="#0000ff">moving day</font></a>, at either 

										your old or new residence. If your 

										cellular telephone number was provided 

										to us, please be sure to have your phone 

										turned on, near you, with sufficient 

										battery supply. We will normally give 

										our customer a call if we are running 

										late beyond 15 minutes. If you did not 

										provide us with a cellular telephone 

										number, please be sure that your home 

										telephone is connected and still 

										operating on moving day. If your home 

										telephone happens to be disconnected, 

										and if you happen to live in a building 

										with an intercom system, be aware that 

										your intercom may not work since this is 

										usually connected to your telephone 

										line.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Set Aside the Following:</b><br>

										Legal, medical and insurance documents, laptops, new 
										and old keys, checkbook, cash, medicine, jewelry, items 
										of small size that are of exceptional value (either sentimental 
										or monetary). You might also want to have a set of comfortable 
										clothing for after the move, along with toiletries, cosmetics, 
										toothbrush and water.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>When the Movers Arrive:</b><br>

										Have the door and gate propped open, 

										otherwise your movers will take care of 

										it. Be sure to have the hallways free 

										and clear of boxes and debris. This 

										makes it easier for the movers to start. 

										Be ready to complete and sign the 

										contract. Don't get nervous and do not 

										sign anything unless it seems clear to 

										you. Ask as many questions as you wish. 

										Your mover will provide to you free of 

										charge a booklet called &quot;Important 

										Information For Persons Moving Household 

										Goods (within California)&quot;. This booklet 

										informs you about your moving rights. We 

										recommend you read this booklet in case 

										something goes wrong with your move. 

										Keep your contract, the booklet and our 

										business card with you at all times 

										during the move. Be prepared to give us 

										a tour of your home to show us 

										everything that is being moved to the 

										new location (including lawn furniture, 

										plants, bicycles and stored items in 

										basement/garage or hidden closets), and 

										what is not. If possible, set aside 

										those items which are not being moved, 

										or mark them with a sign. It is also 

										very important that you advise your 

										movers of any delicate piece of 

										furniture, or items of high sentimental 

										or monetary value, or of special care 

										required for the premises (new carpet, 

										newly painted walls or refinished 

										hardwood floors, etc.) Your movers will 

										be able to give some extra attention to 

										these special items. Keep the vacuum 

										aside and readily available to clean the 

										wall-to-wall carpet or rugs as we empty 

										out your residence.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Last Check:</b><br>

										Take one last look around. Locate the 

										keys to the new residence. Turn off the 

										furnace and lights. Close and lock 

										doors. Take a last minute tour of your 

										place, including closets and closed off 

										areas, back yard and basement/garage for 

										forgotten items. Arrange for dropping 

										off/picking up keys with landlord or 

										agent if necessary.</font></p>

										<p>

										<font color="#000033" face="Arial" size="2">

										<b>Forms of Payment:</b><br>

										Payment is due in full once your move is completed. 
										We require cash or check as payment. If you decide to tip 
										the movers, it will be best if you tip by cash, otherwise 
										you may add it to the check. No Billing. Moves far away 
										from San Francisco and/or moves to a storage facility 
										will require "cash" as the only form of payment. </font></p>
